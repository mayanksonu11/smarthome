# Smart Home
Smart home is a visionary idea which includes many aspects like Remote Switching, House Safety, Smart devices and so on. The whole effort is to bring more quality experience to the people living in house.
Covering all the aspects is a huge step to go but in this we have covered remote switching part. As every project of IoT has some hardware and software component we also have the same.
Let's dig into it.

### Hardware Component
1. ESP-8266 (NODEMCU)
2. Relay 

### Software Component
1. MQTT Protocol for communication
2. JSON for message formatting
3. HTML, CSS, php and JavaScript for developing user-interface

####One should have a basic understanding to understand what's going on in the code

### Future Scope specific to current work:
1. Add digital fan speed controller
2. Implement Machine Learning models to find out optimum fan speed at different weather parameters
3. Automatic fan turn off when no person is at home

### Future additions in whole project concerned with Video Processing:
1. Creation of Image Recognition based video camera with by name greeting message
2. Inclusion of security surveliance based on movement and/or sound detection when no one is at home
